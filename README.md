# Google Excel Project: Analyzing Late Deliveries in Shipping
Imagine you’re a data analyst intern at a retail company that sells products across different regions. The company wants to understand why some of their deliveries are late and how they can improve their shipping process. For this project, our goal is to analyze the data about customer orders, shipping methods, and product information to find patterns that could explain the risk of late deliveries and help the company make better decisions. 
For the project will be working with the three different data sets:
#### 1.	Order Table: 
This data set contains information about the orders, including the date, shipping mode and whether the other is a risk for late delivery. 
#### 2.	Customer Table: 
This data set contains customer information such as their name, city, and state.
#### 3.	Product Table: 
This data set contain product details such as the product names, category, and price.

Our goal for this project is analyze the corresponding data sets in Microsoft Excel to provide useful insights to the company and answer the following questions:
#### •	Does the shipping mode affect the risk of late deliveries?
#### •	Are certain regions more likely to have late deliveries?
#### •	Are certain product categories more likely to be associate with late deliveries?
#### •	Who are the top customers with the latest deliveries?
#### •	What percentage of total orders are at risk for late delivery?

Our objective is to perform a basic data analysis on the data set to answer the questions listed above. With the use of Excel, we will perform a step-by-step analysis to understand and prepare the data, clean the data and answer the key questions using visualization tools such as charts and pivot tables.
